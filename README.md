# PRODIGY_DS_01
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for Task 1 of my Data Science Internship at ProdigyInfotech. The task focuses on exploring and analyzing population data across various countries from 1960 to 2023. The goal is to derive meaningful insights and visualizations that highlight demographic trends over time.

# Data
The data-sets used for this analysis:
<ul> <li>Total Population: Population counts from 1960 to 2023.</li>
<li>Male Population: Gender-specific population data across the same years.</li>
<li>Female Population: Gender-specific population data across the same years.</li></ul>

# Knowledge Gained

<ul><li>Data Manipulation.</li>
<li>Data Visualization.</li>
<li> Strengthened my understanding of writing clean, modular, and reusable code for data analysis tasks using R.</li></ul>
